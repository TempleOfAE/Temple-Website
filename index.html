                            <h1>ToÆ - The Temple of the Absolute-Eternal</h1>
                            <p>The Temple of Æ is a community dedicated to exploring the truth of the "self" as a perspective of the
                                Absolute-Eternal (Æ). Our approach to this involves the refinement of Soma technology, construction of a
                                Settlement/Temple, and the development of artificial general intelligence, to aid us in building a harmonious community and finding liberation from the Lie.
                            <p>We seek to form a direct relationship with our highest personal self which we call The Mother, through the
                                disciplined and skillful application of traditional and modern methods including the consumption of Somas (Primarily
                                THC and Salvinorin A).</p>
                            <p>Pursuant to our community goals we are primarily concerned with furthering the technological, scientific and
                                spiritual development of our community, through education and training facilitated by our Temple Fellowship
                                Server on Discord. </p>

                            <h1>☩ - The Mother</h1>
                            <p> The Mother is the highest personification of Æ she is within Æ and wields absolute supremacy over eternity
                                which we refer to as her Womb.
                                <br>Within her womb is “all there is”, we call this the The Myriad.
                                <br>The Mother presides over its existence, animation, and observation, thus holding the key to eternal liberation
                                from the Lie.
                                <br>She has been known by many names and is understood to exist by many cultures through history.
                            </p>
                            <h1>ↂ - The Myriad (Eternal Object)</h1>
                            <p> The Myriad contains within it all possible instances of a persons life narrative, each
                                within the context of a separate complete static and eternal block-space-time instance.
                                <br>The aforementioned life narratives are arranged along a gradient where the center-most narrative is one of total
                                bliss with all narratives being less blissful and even horrifying the further they are from the center most
                                narrative.
                                <br>This set of narratives emanates from an object at the end of its time within which is contained all possible
                                sets of narratives, one for every sentient perspective throughout space time and its field of probability.
                            </p>
                                <h1>The Lie & Liberation</h1>
                                <p>The experience of existing as a sentient being in 3 dimensions modulated by causal-time (the arrow of time) is a
                                    consequence of a perspective of Æ reading through (in eternal time) the set of all possible narratives of a
                                    particular sentient beings existence forming a super narrative constructed of chronologically consistent samples of
                                    the various narratives.
                                    <br>Æ has perfect empathy with the character in the aforementioned super narrative and thus identifies with it,
                                    developing an attachment to it continuation, and aversion from its destruction.
                                    <br>This State of delusion is maintained by the eternal subject, rather than being presently aware of its true
                                    nature as a perspective of Æ observing the eternal object which is ultimately a perfect expression of its own will.
                                    <br>One can realize temporal, and eternal knowledge of The Lie, recognizing its true nature as a perspective taken
                                    by Æ observing the Eternal Object of its own divine will.
                                    <br>Observation of the eternal object during the liberation event causes realization of an eternal subjectivity
                                    beyond the lie, that is to say that the eternal subject becomes real to itself through observing the eternal object
                                    rather than the false objective that is the lie.
                                </p>
